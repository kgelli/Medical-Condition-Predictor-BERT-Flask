## Master's Capstone Project
**Student:** Kusal Venkata Sai Shravanth Gelli  
**Project Advisor:** Dr. Anu Bourgeous  
**Institution:** Georgia State University  

## Project Overview
An AI-powered web application that predicts medical conditions from patient-described symptoms and provides drug recommendations based on real patient reviews and ratings.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions** using TF-IDF vectorization and Passive Aggressive Classification
- **Real Patient Reviews** with interactive modal interface
- **Drug Recommendations** based on 161K+ medical records
- **Modern Responsive UI** with Bootstrap 5
- **Professional Medical Disclaimers**
- **Real-time Processing** with performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data Processing:** 161K+ drug reviews from Drugs.com dataset

## Supported Medical Conditions
- High Blood Pressure
- Depression
- Diabetes Type 2
- Birth Control
